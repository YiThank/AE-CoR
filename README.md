Accurate and timely identification of potentially necrotic intestinal segments during surgery is critical for surgical decision-making, yet existing classification methods heavily rely on labeled data or struggle to capture early subtle abnormal features. This study aims to achieve sensitive detection of potentially necrotic intestinal segments through an unsupervised one-class classification method based on autoencoder (AE) residuals. The AE was trained using readily available multispectral data from the normal small intestine to construct residuals that amplify abnormal spectral differences.
